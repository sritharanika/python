Background:

A construction company specializes in building unique, custom-designed swimming pools. One of their popular offerings is circular swimming pools. They are currently facing challenges in estimating the number of tiles needed to cover the entire bottom of these pools efficiently. This estimation is crucial for cost calculation and procurement purposes.



Problem Statement:

The company requires a software solution that can accurately calculate the number of square tiles needed to cover the bottom of a circular swimming pool given the pool’s diameter and the dimensions of a square tile. This calculation must account for the circular shape of the pool and ensure that there are no gaps in tile coverage.



Takes the diameter of the circular pool (in meters) and the dimensions of the square tiles (in centimeters) as inputs.

Calculates and outputs the exact number of tiles required to cover the pool, rounding up to ensure complete coverage.

Question text

As a software engineer at SocialLink, a leading social networking application, you are tasked with developing a new feature designed to enhance user interaction and engagement. The company aims to introduce a system where users can form connections based on shared interests and activities. One of the feature's components involves analyzing pairs of users based on the activities they've participated in, specifically looking at the numerical difference in the number of activities each user has participated in.

Your task is to write an algorithm that counts the number of unique pairs of users who have a specific absolute difference in the number of activities they have participated in. This algorithm will serve as the backbone for a larger feature that recommends user connections based on shared participation patterns.

Problem Statement

Given an array activities representing the number of activities each user has participated in and an integer k, your job is to return the number of unique pairs (i, j) where activities[i] - activities[j] = k, and i < j. The absolute difference between the activities should be exactly k.

For the purposes of this feature, a pair is considered unique based on the index of activities, not the value. That is, if there are two users with the same number of activities, they are considered distinct entities.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n, the size of the array nums.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, nums[i].

The third line contains an integer, k.


Output Format

Return a single integer representing the number of unique pairs (i, j) 

where | nums[i] - nums[j] | = k and i < j.


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

-104 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 104

0 ≤ k ≤ 104

Background:

Dr. John Wesley maintains a spreadsheet with student records for academic evaluation. The spreadsheet contains various data fields including student IDs, marks, class names, and student names. The goal is to develop a system that can calculate the average marks of all students listed in the spreadsheet.



Problem Statement:

Create a Python-based solution that can parse input data representing a list of students with their respective marks and other details, and compute the average marks. The input may present these details in any order, so the solution must be adaptable to this variability.



Input Format:



The first line contains an integer N, the total number of students.

The second line lists column names in any order (ID, NAME, MARKS, CLASS).

The next N lines provide student data corresponding to the column headers.

Output Format:



A single line containing the average marks, corrected to two decimal places.

Constraints:



1≤N≤100

Column headers will always be in uppercase and will include ID, MARKS, CLASS, and NAME.

Marks will be non-negative integers.



For example:

Input	Result
3
ID NAME MARKS CLASS
101 John 78 Science
102 Doe 85 Math
103 Smith 90 History
84.33
3
MARKS CLASS NAME ID
78 Science John 101
85 Math Doe 102
90 History Smith 103

def calculate_average_marks(N, columns, student_data):
    total_marks = 0
    num_students = 0

    # Find the index of the 'MARKS' column
    marks_index = columns.index('MARKS')

    # Iterate through the student data to calculate total marks
    for student in student_data:
        # Extract marks for the current student
        marks = int(student[marks_index])
        total_marks += marks
        num_students += 1

    # Calculate the average marks
    average_marks = total_marks / num_students if num_students > 0 else 0

    return average_marks

# Read input
N = int(input())
columns = input().split()
student_data = [input().split() for _ in range(N)]

# Calculate average marks
average_marks = calculate_average_marks(N, columns, student_data)

# Print the result with two decimal places
print("{:.2f}".format(average_marks))
